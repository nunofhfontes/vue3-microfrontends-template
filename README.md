# vue3-mf-boilerplate

This is a project to show how to build MicroFrontends with Vue 3. This project will be a main-app with the capability to lazy load MicroFrontends and display them on the webpage.

These MicroFrontends can be built using the Web Components (W3C) concept, which means that MicroFrontends are normal webapps but wrapped in Web Components.

The main-app will have the responsability to download the MicroFrontend's scripts, which will happen when routing between pages. The downloads are triggered when Vue is trying to change route, in the router guards.

A MicroFrontend script is download before the page change, and when the page actually changes, the new component that Vue inserts on the page will have the MicroFrontends custom element, which will be activated because it's script was previously downloaded in between page change.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
